        "desText1": "MUL is designed to facilitate your learning of unit conversion through mnemonic methods, optimizing your neural resources for mathematical problem solving and reducing the effort required for unit conversion. <br>MUL prevents you from performing mathematical calculations, but does not omit the conversion process; rather, it integrates it into each exercise, facilitating your memorization of conversion factors. By including these factors and displaying them for a longer period of time, the tool's memorability will reduce your possibility of making mistakes when converting International System (SI) units."
